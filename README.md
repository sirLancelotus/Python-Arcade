Hi!
I'm learning Python since last year, and right now I want to learn the Arcade library for writing my own simple arcade game.
Here I'll do some exercises from https://learn.arcade.academy/index.html
Don't know, who will visit this repository and read it, so why am i writing this? :D
Honestly, i'm just learning how to use GitHub with it's repositories, branches etc., and this repository is just a praxis
